Spline interpolation (cubic splines)

The system must realize following requirements:
1. System must provide a choice of functions and [a, b] range for the user.
2. System provides the user with 2 charts: chart of the chosen function and the interpolated data.
3. System must provide the user with possibility of getting Y value out of the X value the user inputs.

Program must validate data and inform the user about errors as well.

System of linear equations is calculated by Iterative method realized in lab 1.
